# 2. Data Storage Architecture

Date: 2025-02-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context


From the experience from a data provider with many different products to offer, a SQL database is really critical for supporting the different complex queries that need to be performed.
However this Tractus-X SDK implementation does not requires persistence at all, since the persistance is located in the service that contain the original data (Digital Twin Registry, EDC, etc.)

The Tractus-X SDK will have a memory/cache mechanism so it can store just the operations that were performed in a short time, and this data format:


```py


class edcService:

    memory_cache: dict

    def __init__(self, disabled=true):
        self.memory_cache = {}
    
    # EXAMPLE
    def add_connection(self, edc_url, bpn, dct_type, policies):
        self.memory_cache[bpn] = {}
        self.memory_cache[bpn][edc_url] = dct_type
        ...

```

The persistence layer will be done in the Use Case applications or in the Industry Core Hub Backend using whatever they want.

They can decide which technology (SQL or NO-SQL).

## Decision

The Tractus-X SDK will provide an in memory cache for the Microservice Server (FAST-API) but it can be disabled per parameters.
The Storage Architecture will not be specified in the SDK, need to be specified in the application that uses it.

## Consequences

- Applications need to implement their own persistence layer
- If the application services (EDC, DTR, and data storage) are down then we can't know what was registered and when.
