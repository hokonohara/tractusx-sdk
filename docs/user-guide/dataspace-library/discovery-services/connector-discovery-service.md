# Connector Discovery Service

The Connector Discovery Service helps you find connector endpoints for other companies (identified by their Business Partner Numbers or BPNs) in the Tractus-X dataspace. Once you know where a partner's connector is, you can start exchanging data with them.

## How it works

This service works together with the Discovery Finder Service:

1. The Discovery Finder tells it where to look for connector information
2. It searches for connectors using a company's BPN  
3. It gives you back the connector endpoints you can use to communicate

It also caches results so you don't have to look up the same information repeatedly.

## What it does

- **Find connectors**: Give it a BPN, get back connector URLs
- **Cache results**: Remembers previous lookups to speed things up  
- **Handle authentication**: Works with OAuth2 automatically
- **Support different formats**: Adapts to various API response formats

The service makes it simple to find and connect to other participants in the dataspace without worrying about the underlying complexity.

## Available methods

| Method | Parameters | What it does |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| `find_connector_by_bpn` | `bpn: str`, `bpn_key: str="bpn"`, `connector_endpoint_key: str="connectorEndpoint"` | Finds connector endpoints for a BPN |
| `get_discovery_url` | `discovery_finder_service: DiscoveryFinderService`, `discovery_key: str` | Gets the discovery URL for a specific key |

## Getting started

### What you need

Import the required components:

```python
from tractusx_sdk.dataspace.managers import OAuth2Manager
from tractusx_sdk.dataspace.services.discovery import DiscoveryFinderService, ConnectorDiscoveryService
```

### Basic setup

```python
# Set up authentication
oauth_manager = OAuth2Manager(
    realm="CX-Central",
    clientid="your-client-id",
    clientsecret="your-client-secret",
    auth_url="https://your-auth-server.com/auth/"
)
oauth_manager.connect()

# Set up discovery finder (see Discovery Finder docs for details)
discovery_finder = DiscoveryFinderService(
    url="https://your-discovery-finder.com/api/v1.0/administration/connectors/discovery/search",
    oauth=oauth_manager
)

# Create connector discovery service
connector_discovery = ConnectorDiscoveryService(
    oauth=oauth_manager,
    discovery_finder_service=discovery_finder,
    connector_discovery_key="bpn",          # Optional, defaults to "bpn"
    cache_timeout_seconds=43200,            # Optional, defaults to 12 hours
    verbose=False,                          # Optional, defaults to False
    logger=None                             # Optional, provide custom logger
)
```

## Basic usage

```python
# Find connector endpoints for a company
bpn = "BPNL000000000001"
connector_endpoints = connector_discovery.find_connector_by_bpn(bpn)

if connector_endpoints:
    print(f"Found {len(connector_endpoints)} connectors for {bpn}:")
    for endpoint in connector_endpoints:
        print(f"  - {endpoint}")
else:
    print(f"No connectors found for {bpn}")
```

If your API uses different field names in the response, you can customize them:

```python
# For APIs with different response format
connector_endpoints = connector_discovery.find_connector_by_bpn(
    bpn="BPNL000000000001",
    bpn_key="bpn",        # If response uses different BPN field name
    connector_endpoint_key="endpointUrls"   # If response uses different endpoint field name
)
```

## Working with the cache

The service caches discovery URLs to avoid repeated lookups:

```python
# Clear cached results for the default discovery key
connector_discovery.invalidate_cache_entry()

# Or clear for a specific key
connector_discovery.invalidate_cache_entry("bpn")

# Clear all cached discovery URLs
cleared_count = connector_discovery.flush_cache()
print(f"Cleared {cleared_count} cached entries")

# Check cache status
cache_info = connector_discovery.get_cache_status()
print(f"Cache contains {cache_info['total_entries']} entries")
```

## Error handling

```python
try:
    connectors = connector_discovery.find_connector_by_bpn("BPNL000000000001")
    if connectors:
        print(f"Found connectors: {connectors}")
    else:
        print("No connectors found for this BPN")
        
except ConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Authentication problem: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Something went wrong: {e}")
```

## Common problems

### Authentication not connected

Make sure you connect to OAuth2 first:

```python
oauth_manager.connect()  # Do this before using the service
```

### Connector discovery endpoint not found

- Check your discovery finder URL is correct
- Verify the discovery key ("bpn") exists in the system

### Empty results

- The BPN might not exist in the dataspace
- The company might not have any registered connectors yet
- Try a different BPN to test if the service is working

## Debugging

Turn on verbose logging to see what's happening:

```python
connector_discovery = ConnectorDiscoveryService(
    oauth=oauth_manager,
    discovery_finder_service=discovery_finder,
    verbose=True  # This will show detailed logs
)
```

!!! tip
    - **Cache timeout**: The default 12-hour cache works for most cases, but adjust if endpoints change frequently
    - **Batch lookups**: If you need to find multiple BPNs, consider caching the discovery service instance  
    - **Error handling**: Always check if endpoints are returned before trying to use them
    - **Security**: Store OAuth2 credentials in environment variables, not in code
