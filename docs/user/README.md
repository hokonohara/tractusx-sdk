# Recommended Uses of SDK

The SDK was developed with the following use cases in mind, but we hope it is useful beyond this list:

- **Simplified Interaction with Tractus-X Components**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with Eclipse Tractus-X components, reducing the complexity of direct API calls.
- **Abstracted Component Management**: Avoid the need for deep exploration of individual components or their releases. The SDK handles compatibility and updates, allowing developers to focus on their core tasks.
- **Standardized Protocols and Security**: Ensure secure communication and compliance with standards like AAS 3.0 by leveraging built-in protocol and security configurations.
- **Interoperability**: Enable seamless integration with external systems by supporting standardized formats, references, and protocols.

We encourage users to explore and adapt the SDK to their specific needs!
